# Evolution-Simulator
Duration: November 2019

This was the first big coding project I ever worked on. It was my term project for my introduction to programming class which taught me my first langauge: python. Because this was a project for my class, there were deadlines and grades at stake and as such this project took me 3 weeks to create. This project holds a special place in my heart because it made me realize how much I learned in the class that I was able to code something like this. It also made me realize how powerful coding and computer science can be and it has set off my journey in CS.

This simulation was based on a series of evolution videos by the youtuber, Primer. In his video, he explores how natural selection forces species to evolve base on their environment. He looks at how species with certain traits thrive and pass on their genes and over time, a certain species will dominate an environment. In this project I simply wanted to recreate his simulations and possibly add on to it.

As part of the project's requirement, I had to make a short video detailing the main features of the project: Evolution Simulator Video. In short, the user initializes an environment by setting factors such as food abundancy, initial species population, species trait, and more. When the simulation starts, the user can sit back and watch as the species compete for food. If the species do not eat enough food for that generation, it dies, or if it eats enough to reproduce, it will produce an offspring for the next generation with the same traits. After some time, we can view the graph and see how the certain traits, or population changed over time. Through these graphs we can see useful characterics of these species like carrying capacity or the average size or speed. If we like, we can run the simulations for hundreds of generation to see how the species will evolved or we can play god and actively tweak aspects of the environment like changing food abundance, adding invasive species or causing natural disasters. These user controlled features allow us to see how species can respond to external stimuli and see how dynamic they are to these disturbances.

The main focus of this project was to visualize evolution through natural selection and to track the mirco and marco changes that contributed to the ecosystem.
